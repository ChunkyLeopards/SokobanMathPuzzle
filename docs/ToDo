   fetched from the same file on different machines. May only affect different operating systems. Further
   testing required.

3) Add more puzzles.
4) Add more math templates.
5) Implement all buttons in math input.
6) Implement all other buttons in various locations (Credits and Options on the main menu, overview, etc.).

   external wall is complete, check that all internal space is an internal tile of some type, check
   that all internal space is connected, no more than 1 player, etc.
